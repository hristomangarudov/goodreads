      I'm not a reader of YA but the story did interest me and pull me in. It moved slower than I would have preferred, and I could have done without so much romance. The characters were interesting but I would have liked to see some hint of their futures.`,

It seemed to be mostly based on physical attraction and the little bit they knew of each other through fighting together or against each other. Which works for initial feelings, but they jumped straight into being all-in and wanting to commit. To be fair, it's not hard to understand why Remy, or anyone, would want Zidan. He was smart, a skilled fighter, poised, kind, supportive, sexy, and a broody vampire, to boot. But even that isn't quite enough for me to actually feel the romantic chemistry between two characters.`,
